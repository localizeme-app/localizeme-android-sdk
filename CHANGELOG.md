# Changelog

## 1.0.0

- The first stable release. From here on, only a new major version breaks
  source compatibility.
- Consent levels for apps that ask the user first (Usercentrics, OneTrust,
  Didomi…): full, strings only, and off, set in the configuration and with
  `LocalizeMe.setConsent`. See "Consent" in the README.
- **Source-breaking:** a new error kind, `ErrorKind.CONSENT_OFF`, for checks skipped while
  consent is off. A `switch`/`when` that lists every kind needs a branch for it.
